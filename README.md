# Weather Rain Forecast with Machine Learnings Methods

Weather forecasting is an important part of our life. Estimation of weather parameters temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind direction, wind intensity are great importance in many areas like energy, health, geography, agriculture, transportation. The importance of accurate weather forecasts is increasing that the weather conditions are changing because of global warming and climate change. Nowadays, weather forecasts are based on models. In old times, predictions were tried to made by following the pressure changes or clouds but these are not needed with the developing technology. The best way for weather forecasting is to forecast by model.
In this study, weather data in a randomly selected city between 1948 and 2017 was used. The data were processed with K-Nearest Neighbor and Naive Bayes algorithms by using the maximum temperature(fahrenheit) during the day, the minimum temperature(fahrenheit) during the day and the amount of precipitation(inches). Thus, the rain forecast rate of weather is %76 and %99.
